## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Integrating with [Angular Landing page](https://themeforest.net/item/angular-landing-material-design-angular-app-landing-page/21198258)
  Folder structures are same for both projects. 
  1. Replace MatX Admin's 'home' with Angular landing's 'home' folder inside app/views.
  2. Uncomment @import "views/landing"; inside assets/styles/scss/_views.scss
